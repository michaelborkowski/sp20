![](/static/img/trinity.png){#fig:types .align-center width=60%}

- Core program element is an **expression**
- Every _valid_ expression has a **type** (determined at compile-time)
- Every _valid_ expression reduces to a _value_ (computed at run-time)


**Execution** 

- Basic values & operators 

- Execution / Function Calls just *substitute equals by equals*

- Pack data into *tuples* & *lists*

- Unpack data via *pattern-matching*
